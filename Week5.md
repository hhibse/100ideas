Sustainable Cities: Copenhagen, Denmark 

- Creating communities that are sustainable are more important now then they have ever been because of the increasingly dire consequences of non sustainable living. The city of Copenhagen aims to be the first carbon- neutral city.
- The most important team of people currently developing further on this project is a team of people led by Lykke Leonardsen that is working on a long term climate change adaptation that will prepare the city for the increasing effects of climate change (planning ahead to the year 2100). Issues like rising sea levels and increasing participation have already made a noticeable difference to their environment.
-  The functioning community is seen as revolutionary, not only because of it’s growing alternatives to non-sustainable living, especially with the effects of global warming actively working against them. According to The Guardian, the city has already achieved “...a 20% reduction in both heat and commercial electricity consumption; 75% of all journeys to be by bike, on foot, or by public transport; the biogas-ification of all organic waste; 60,000 sq metres of new solar panels; and 100% of the city’s heating requirements to be met by renewables”.
