1. The most realistic looking and feeling robotic animal to date is being used to treat symtomes of dementia. Support animals have had a proven positive effect on the behavioral and phycological symptoms of dementia.However, many seniors cannot care for a live animal, creating a need for a support animal that does not require a lot of maintnence. However, many of the patients believe it is a real dog, and ignore any corrections. This has sparked a debate about the morality of teh invention.

2. Scientists have begun 3D printing organs and tissues using a technology called bioprinting. Once the technology is perfected, it will eliminate many of the complications surrounding organ transplants. Not only would the immense demand for new organs be met, but each organ would be tailored to the recipient, making it less likely for the body to reject it. The valves and other aspects of the heart specifically have been harder to replicate, but the body of the organs have been created using a printing material containing actual cells.

3. Dubai's sustainable city aims to be as energy efficient as possible. All structures are design facing specific directions and in specific locations to create cool environments without using energy. All water is treated and reused. Most of the energy used by the city comes from solar panels that also act as shade in the community parking lot. Any extra amenities (like planter boxes) are constructed out of the waste producted from the construction of the city. 

4. Portle is the newest holigram technology that creates a more efficient, and more detailed image. It is not technically a holigram, but a box with a 4k LCD screen that can produce life sized pre recordings or live images. Creator David Nussbaum stated that while developing the technology, he looked at all the reasons somone has chosen not to use a holigram and eliminated all of them.
